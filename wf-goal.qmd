{{< include content/_wip.qmd >}}

**Bolded** items are clear hooks for tools, rules, standards. 

`AP[X]` is the Xth analysis planning stage
`R[X]` is the Xth artefact of the analysis process

1. Pre-contract
  + Proposal
  + Research objectives
  + `AP0`: **Preliminary plan**
    - `R0`: **High-level methodology**
2. Data design
  + Survey designs
  + Admin datasets
  + `AP1`: **Specify approach**
    - `R1`: **Detailed methodology**
    - `R2`: **Input data dictionary**
3. Data collection
  + Monitoring: 
    - `R3`: **Monitoring log**
4. Analyze
  + Have the data for the analysis
  + Have accumulated insights 
  + Have monitoring logs
  + Explore loop: 
    - `R4`: **Exploratory output pile** 
    - `R5`: **Decision log**
  + `AP2`: revisit `R1`: **Detailed methodology**
    - Realign analysis objectives with project objectives
    - Assess feasibility through exploration
    - Identify limitations and enumerate implications
    - Justify methodological adapatations
    - Iteratively build `R6`: **data pipeline**
    - Document final data pipeline
    - Finalize methodology
5. Publish
  + `AP3`: **Schedule of deliverable outputs**
    - `R7`: **Analysis outputs**
